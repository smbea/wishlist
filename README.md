# Wishlist
This is a project based on TypeScript/React/ExpressJS that will consist of an online wishlist where you can enter URLS of the items you wish to buy and save them all in one place.
It will use a [scrapper](https://github.com/smbea/ecommerce-scrapper) to extract the item information from the URL.
